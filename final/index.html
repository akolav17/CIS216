            <h2>What is Bone?</h2>
            <p>Bone is an American independently-published graphic novel series, written and illustrated by Jeff Smith, originally serialized in 55 irregularly released issues from 1991 to 2004.</p>
            <p>Smith's black-and-white drawings, inspired by animated cartoons and comic strips, are singularly characterized by a mixture of both light-hearted comedy and dark fantasy thriller. The author, Jeff Smith, describes the comics as "a fish-out-of-water story. There are three modern characters who happen to be cartoons in the mold of Donald Duck or Bugs Bunny, and get lost in a fairy-tale valley. They spend a year there and make friends and enemies, finding themselves caught up in the trials and tribulations of the valley, and even a war".</p>
            <p>The series was published bimonthly with some delays from June 1991 to June 2004. The series was self-published by Smith's Cartoon Books for issues No. 1 to No. 19, by Image Comics from issues No. 20 to No. 28, and back to Cartoon Books for issues No. 29 to No. 55.</p>
            <p>Bone has received numerous awards, among them ten Eisner Awards and eleven Harvey Awards.</p>
            <p>In October 2019, Netflix announced the production of an upcoming Bone animated series.</p>
